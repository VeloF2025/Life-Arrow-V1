# Appointment Booking Flow

## Selection Order Logic

The appointment booking process follows this specific sequence to ensure the most efficient and user-friendly experience:

1. **Client Selection (First)**
   - The client must be selected first as the starting point
   - This centers the booking process around the client's needs
   - All subsequent choices are filtered based on the selected client

2. **Treatment Centre Selection**
   - Once a client is selected, the next step is to choose a treatment centre
   - Centres may be filtered based on client location or preferences
   - This selection narrows down the available services and staff

3. **Service Selection**
   - After selecting a centre, the user chooses a specific service
   - Only services available at the selected centre are shown
   - Service selection determines duration and required staff qualifications

4. **Staff Selection**
   - Based on the selected service, only qualified staff members who:
     - Work at the selected centre
     - Are qualified to perform the selected service
     - Are available during the potential appointment times
   - This ensures proper matching of staff skills to service requirements

5. **Date Selection**
   - After selecting staff, the user chooses an available date
   - Dates are filtered to show only those when the selected staff member works
   - Unavailable dates should be disabled or visually indicated

6. **Time Slot Selection**
   - Finally, available time slots for the selected date are shown
   - Time slots account for:
     - Staff availability
     - Service duration
     - Centre operating hours
     - Existing bookings
   - When slots are full, the system should suggest the next available slot

## Handling Full Bookings

When a desired time slot is unavailable:
- The system should automatically suggest the next available time slot for the selected combination of centre, service, and staff
- Alternatively, offer the option to select a different staff member qualified for the same service
- Provide clear visual feedback about why a slot is unavailable

## Implementation Notes

- Each dropdown should be disabled until its prerequisite selection is made
- Helpful placeholder text should guide users through the selection process
- Loading states should be shown while fetching filtered options
- Error handling should gracefully manage cases where no options are available

## Data Dependencies

- Client data: Personal information, preferences, history
- Centre data: Location, operating hours, available services
- Service data: Duration, required qualifications, pricing
- Staff data: Qualifications, working hours, assigned centres
- Booking data: Existing appointments that affect availability

This logical flow ensures a streamlined booking process that minimizes errors and maximizes efficiency.
